1. nn1.py - this is an simple demo of how the neural network works however it is not trained and thus only gives out random guesses ðŸ™‚
2. nn2.py - simulates the training of the neural network by finding the slope(derivative) of the cost function
3. nnf.py - final implementation of the above scripts for a fully working model.ðŸ˜‰
